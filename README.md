# Valentine's Day 2023

This is a simple animated SVG using path, ellipse, circle and text tags.

## Defs
- `heartGradient` defines a radial gradient that goes from pink to red, to brown to simulate a 3D effect on the heart.
- `shadowGradient` defines a grey to white radial gradient to simulate a shadow with a penumbra.
- `moteGradient` defines a radial gradient that goes from opaque yellow to transparent yellow, to simulate a mote of yellow light.

## Path
- This uses simple curves to form a heart, and is filled using `heartGradient`.

## Ellipse
- This is a flat ellipse under the heart, and is filled using `shadowGradient`.

## Circle
- These are various elements behind and in front of the "heart", of various sizes. 
- The animations are varied as well, with different start delays, durations and travelling distances.

## Text
- Simple pink text.
